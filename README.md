# GameStateInClass
##Welcome to 3-0-Uno!

###Things to note:
    - Personally, we believe the project is worth 2* instead of 1*. This is because we have 4 players rather than 2,
      a complexity that only one other team has. Along with this, we have a lot more aspects
      of complex rendering than the other teams, and we had to work around a lot of the limitations
      of the game framework with our project.
    - Uno button is not fully implemented. The game framework has a lot of issue with attempting to
      edit 
    -Testing occurs in the branch, TestBranch. We did this as the testing crashed our GUIs in the main
     branch.
    -Turn your volume up if you would like to enhance the overall play experience with an original song :D
    -Feel free to customize the name of your opponents in your lobby
    -Network play appears to be functional on UPIoT network, not the guest. Ensure you select "Local Player"
     in the player menu on the remote player's tablet before connecting. Else, you will not be able
     to see the moves made.
